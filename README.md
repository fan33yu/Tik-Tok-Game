##MIT Boot camp
this code is for practice by MIT boot camp

##Roadmap
improvement:
1,Name one or two features you’d like to implement

a square be used,  when a player try to take again, show a message: square be used;

2,How would you implement those features? Write 2–3 sentences per feature

setup a component: const UsedSquare = ({id, player}) => {....; return alert(Square(id) used by player()")}
